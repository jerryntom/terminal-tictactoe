## About project :information_source:
I have always wanted to make a such simple project. It's nothing complicated but I had a lot of enjoyment during development process.
It was created on May 2021 and has been finally finished on June 2022. Why it took so long? For now I'm moving to web development and I have break from programming in Python. I'm still learning and I have discovered that I want to design websites and make web applications. Anyway, I still have plans to use Python and show how simple it is to make cool things without unnecessary complexity. 

## Gameplay :video_game:

There are two gamemodes. You can choose player vs player or player vs computer gamemode. Follow instruction on the screen and everything should be okay.

## Dependencies :wrench:
There's no requirements for installing any modules for python <br>
Just make sure you had installed python3 before 

## How to play :question:
on Windows:
- just use included .bat file 

on Linux or MacOS:
- execute main.py in terminal by adequate command in project directory
